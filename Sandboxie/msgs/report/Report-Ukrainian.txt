You have installed Sandboxie more than %2 days ago.

So, you think David and the contributors are doing a great job?

Why don't you show it by supporting the project and getting a Supporter Certificate?

Sandboxie without a valid supporter certificate will now pause for a few seconds, to give you time to contemplate the possibility of supporting the project.
